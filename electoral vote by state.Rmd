## Summary

I used 
https://inkplant.com/code/state-latitudes-longitudes
to get all states locations and 
http://state.1keydata.com/state-electoral-votes.php
to get the make this data set -


```{r loadData}
statesData <- read.csv("states.csv")
head(statesData)
```

## Creating the map

I will create a circle that represent the state Electoral Votes For 2016

```{r voteMap}
library(leaflet)
statesData[,2:3] %>% leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>% addCircles(weight=1,radius=statesData$Electoral.Votes*10000)
```

The circle radius size represent the Electoral Votes number
